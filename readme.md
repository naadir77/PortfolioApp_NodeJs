I perpared this node server to start smoothly.

-Step1 : clone this project using ssh key to enable you pull and push request.
-if you dosen't have a ssh key you must install it on your local machine.

-Step 2 intall npm using (npm init) to the project

-The mongodb are usign is a localhost:27017 // 127.0.0.1:27017 are same.

-In this project we will use a mongoose only / you can use mongodb but is taken alot of time.

-.env file used to set the secrite date or private data.

-NOTE: (.env) file I will remove it from github when you clone this project successfully.
